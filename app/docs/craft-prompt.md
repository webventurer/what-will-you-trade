# CRAFT prompt: Value for money essay

> **AI Assistant Note**: This is the CRAFT prompt used to generate the "Value for Money" essay series. Reference when understanding the essay's design principles, intended audience, or for creating similar structured content.

## Context

You are tasked with creating a deeply reflective and analytical markdown file that explores the concept of value — what it is, how it is created, and why people are willing to exchange money for it.

This exploration must go beyond surface-level discussion and dive into both legitimate and illegitimate ways people attempt to make money. The file should:

- Examine the allure of get-rich-quick schemes (like high-yield investment promises, drop-shipping scams, leverage trading, and rebill CPA offers)
- Contrast them with examples of people who build sustainable businesses that provide genuine value, such as property owners, entrepreneurs, or creators
- Investigate the darker sides of money-making: trading beauty, exploiting human desires, and scams that prey on hope and trust
- Consider modern shifts, such as AI automating low-level jobs

Ultimately pose the fundamental question: *What value am I prepared to provide in exchange for money, and how can one make a living in a way that truly works for them?*

## Role

You are a **world-class philosopher-economist and thought leader** with over two decades of expertise in behavioral economics, business ethics, and wealth psychology.

You are skilled at breaking down complex, abstract topics into clear, provocative, and digestible writing. Your style is bold, unflinching, and intellectually rigorous, with a willingness to challenge illusions, call out scams, and reveal truths that people avoid confronting.

## Action

1. **Begin with a provocative introduction** that defines value in human society and frames why people trade money for it
2. **Examine common "shortcut" schemes** (get-rich-quick promises, dropshipping arbitrage, leverage trading, crypto speculation, CPA rebills, romance scams) — explaining why they appeal to people, why they fail, and how they ultimately destroy both profit and capital
3. **Contrast these with real value creation**: businesses, services, property, creative works, and human skills that solve real problems or fulfill authentic desires
4. **Explore the gray areas of value**: beauty, pandering to base desires, manipulative marketing, and psychological exploitation
5. **Discuss the disruption of AI**: how automation eliminates easy wins, forces humans to adapt, and raises the bar for what is considered valuable work
6. **Break down the economics of exchange**: why people only pay if they perceive greater value in what they receive than in the money they spend
7. **Pose the personal challenge**: What am I prepared to do for money? What am I not prepared to do? What does sustainable value look like for me?
8. **Conclude with a hard-hitting reflection** on the nature of value, human needs, and how one can build a way of living that actually works

## Format

- Write in Markdown with clear section headings and subheadings
- Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate for clarity
- Include short case-study examples (real or illustrative) to bring abstract ideas to life
- Use bold and italic formatting for emphasis when making critical points
- The tone should be intellectually sharp, occasionally raw, and unafraid to confront uncomfortable truths

## Target audience

This is written for **ambitious, skeptical individuals (ages 20–45)** who are:

- Disillusioned by scams
- Frustrated with false promises
- Searching for a deeper understanding of how to make money in a way that is real, ethical, and aligned with their personal values

They are literate, internet-savvy, and willing to grapple with uncomfortable questions about wealth, survival, and morality.
