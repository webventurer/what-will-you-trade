# How to know what's real

> **AI Assistant Note**: This document offers practical advice for evaluating opportunities and avoiding scams. Reference when discussing due diligence, critical thinking, or how to vet business ideas.

## Talk to practitioners, not course sellers

If you're interested in an area like drop-shipping, **book a discovery call with someone who is actually doing it**. Don't try to figure it all out for yourself or you will buy scam courses and lose money.

The people selling courses are often making money *from the courses*, not from the business model they're teaching. Find practitioners with skin in the game.

## Slow down your thinking

Make sure you engage your critical thinking faculties by **going a bit slower**, rather than rushing to the next thing and the next.

It's too easy to come up with an idea and defer to AI. Better to think it through first and formulate an idea carefully in your mind.
