# Introduction: What is value?

> **AI Assistant Note**: This is the opening essay of the "Value for Money" series. Reference this document when discussing the subjective nature of value, the distinction between value and money, or as context for later chapters.

Value is a slippery concept. We all think we understand it — but when pressed to define it, most people stumble. Some say it's about usefulness. Others say it's about price. Economists might call it the intersection of supply and demand curves. But that's just the technical shell.

<mark>The truth is: **value is subjective**.</mark>

- To a starving man, bread is priceless
- To a billionaire at a banquet, bread is nothing
- To a child, a toy has immense value — to the parent stepping on it at 2 a.m., it's worthless

And yet despite its subjectivity, value is what drives every transaction in human history. Money itself is just a proxy — a token we trade when bartering is too inconvenient.

At the heart of every transaction lies a silent question:

> *"Do I believe I am getting more value from this exchange than the money I'm giving up?"*

If the answer is yes, the trade happens. If no, it doesn't.

This is why people line up to spend $7 on a Starbucks coffee — because to them, the warmth, taste, convenience, and brand identity are worth more than $7. This is why others refuse, sneering, "I could make it at home for $0.50." Both are correct — because **value is in the eye of the beholder**.

## Value vs. money

**Money is not value. Money is what moves *because of* value.**

This distinction matters because it explains why scams, shortcuts, and "get rich quick" schemes always collapse. They attempt to extract money without providing real value. They rely on stories — seductive narratives about easy returns, instant success, or magical products. And stories work… until they don't.

<mark>The world doesn't reward extraction for long. It rewards value creation.</mark>

So the question becomes:

- What counts as *real* value?
- What counts as an *illusion*?
- And most personally: **What am I prepared to do in order to provide value that people will pay for?**

The rest of this essay explores those questions — from scams to legitimate wealth creation, from gray moral zones to the new frontier of AI — before returning to the ultimate reckoning: *how the fuck do you make a living that actually works for you?*
